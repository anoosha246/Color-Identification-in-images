# Color-Identification-in-images
In this project all colors of an image are extracted and this is shown by the treemap.
This is done using the KMeans algorithm along with some useful libraries like cv2 (for working with images), 
matplotlib (for plotting) and squarify (for plotting the treemap). There is also a sample image for color identification.
